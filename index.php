                     response on the first vontact as well as planning our journey atendimh 
                     to our requirements. They met all our expectations from places to visit
                      and hotels chosen, and they got us a driver for our 6 day stay that made 
                      it all possible. I highly recommend Sri Lanka Travel and Tourism, as our 
                      experience with them was excellent."
